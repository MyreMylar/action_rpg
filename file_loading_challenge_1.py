Challenge 1 - Approx 4 lines of code
-------------------------------------

Load the file 'default_character.txt" and just display it's contents on the screen.

HINTS:
------
 - Use 'open( insert_filename_here, "r")' to open up the file, the "r" is short for 'read'
   this tells the operating system that we just want to read the data in the file
   not edit or 'write' to it.
 - You will also need to assign the open file to a variable using =.
 - Then you can use either the .read() function, the .readline() function or
   preferably a for loop (reads the file line by line) on your new variable to access the data
   in the file as individual strings.
 - You can test your file output using print()
 - Use the print function to display all the data in the file to the screen.
 - You can use the .strip() function on a string to remove new line characters.
 - Use .close() on the file variable when you are done.
