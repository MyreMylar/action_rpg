 Challenge 2a - Approx 3 to 4 lines
 ---------------

 Create a small program to create some character data much like the default
 character file we just loaded in Challenge 1.

 - Open a new file, with the filename "my_new_character.txt",
   using the 'w' parameter for writing. Assign it to a variable.
 - Write two lines of text to it using the .write("your text") function
   you can use \n to move to a new line.
 - Close the file when you are done with .close()

 Once that's done open your newly made file in a text editor
 and check your saved data is in there!

 Challenge 2b - Reduce your code to approx 2 to 3 lines
--------------

 Modify your program from challenge 2 to use python's handy
 'with as' statement.

 Using 'with as' will save you from having to remember to
 close the file when you are done and will ensure
 that the file has definitely opened before running any code
 using the file_variable.

 HINTS
 - You start a with as statement like:
   with open("filename", "mode") as file_variable:
 - Then you remember to indent the code underneath as with any
   code statement.
